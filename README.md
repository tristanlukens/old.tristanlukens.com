My website. I host my blog and post drum covers here. Blog posts are mainly about technology and music.

## Todo

- go back to github for storing posts and covers
- make components for blog and cover pages, it's not dry enough now
- fix images not loading (well, they're not stored anywhere now, so yeah)
- tags should probably be visible on the post selection page
- fix the enumeration capitalisition in meta:desc (DRUM cover and BASS cover)
