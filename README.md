My website. I host my blog and post drum covers here. Blog posts are mainly about technology, music and life.

## Todo

- [ ] ~~go back to github for storing posts and covers~~ **I'll stay with Hygraph for now**
- [ ] make components for blog and cover pages, it's not dry enough now
- [x] ~~fix images not loading (well, they're not stored anywhere now, so yeah)~~
- [x] ~~tags should probably be visible on the post selection page~~
- [x] ~~fix the enumeration capitalisition in meta:desc (DRUM cover and BASS cover)~~
- [ ] fix punycode error (in dev â€” might be a local node issue)
- [ ] add an automatic way to color spans in h2 tags in markdown component
- [ ] marked types declaration error
