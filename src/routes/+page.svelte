**Hulloo! Welcome to my site. Here you can read a bit about me, the projects I've worked on and some articles I wrote about things that interest me. You can also watch me beat my drumset like it owes me a fifty dollars.**

This site was made using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and its Typography plugin. It looks absolutely stunning, so I decided against changing too much of it, especially since most of this site is text-based. You should be aware of the fact that **most of this was not designed by me**. Thank you, Tailwind.

## about<span class="text-amber-500">me</span>

I'm Tristan, sixteen and was born and live in the Netherlands. I like all kinds of foods, my favourite animal is the üêò and I'm a huge perfectionist. I like computers, biking, science, music, reading, F1, rally, and sitcoms (my favourite being Brooklyn 99, but The Office is amazing too). The Hobbit is and probably will for the next while be my favourite book, but I'm reading The Lord of the Rings at the moment. Tolkien is simply incredible.

I play the bass and the drums. Aside from that, I'm a huge music lover ‚Äî I've got a [huge (yet evergrowing) playlist of music I love](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7MKHIXzTUI1g0hT0nAs671?si=fb9331480d89486f) on Spotify. I'll probably write a blog post on that soon as well. My music taste is... diverse, but defined. That is, I like a lot of things, but I know what I like and what I don't.

That's about it. If it's not enough ‚Äî first of all, thank you ‚Äî you could read some articles I wrote at [my blog](/blog), or watch some drum covers over at the [covers tab](/covers).
